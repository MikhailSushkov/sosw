# Extras
This section contains the tools and recommendations for maintainers and contributors of `sosw`.

## Version Release
Make sure that you:
- Read and understand the PR from `X_X_X` branch to `master`.
- Update the version in `setup.py` and `docs/conf.py`

## Docs build
- Make sure that the secrets for `.github/workflows` are up-to-date.
- Make sure that you have the docs hosted in some reliable location.

- RTFM the guidelines of how to publish `sosw` docs and follow recommendations.
